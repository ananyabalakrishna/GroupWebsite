<!--We develop predictive theories and computational tools to establish the fundamental links between crystallography, microstructure and material properties. We use these mathematical tools to discover a new generation of phase transformation materials with superior properties and enhanced lifespans. This theory-based approach will further our understanding on microstructurally engineering materials, such as multiferroics, battery materials, and two-dimensional systems.-->
