Using a combination of total scattering analysis and transmission electron microscopy, Christensen et al. investigate the atomic-scale structure of the rutile (TiO<sub>2</sub>) electrode during charge-discharge process. They demonstrated the phase-change behavior of rutile as it transformed from an ordered to a disordered state with repeated cycling. 

##### Why do these nano-electrodes amorphize and not fracture?

On the theory front, we reasoned as to why the rutile nano-particles amorphized (phase-change behavior) instead of dissipating their stored elastic energy by electrode fracture. Our fracture analysis calculations estimated the critical size of rutile nano-particles below which fracture is suppressed to be ∼20 nm. The nano-particle sizes used in this experiment were about ~11nm.
