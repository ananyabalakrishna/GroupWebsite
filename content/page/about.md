I will be recruiting two PhD students starting August 2020. You neither need to be a coding expert nor have had multiple publications. You simply need to be interested to pursue research at the intersection of solid mechanics, materials and mathematics. Please feel free to email me with questions at [arenukab@umn.edu](mailto:arenukab@umn.edu).
